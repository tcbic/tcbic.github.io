# About Me

Hello, my name is Taylor.

Steve Jobs once said, "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards." As I think about where I've been, I reflect on the fact that my experiences in non-profit service work and e-commerce share one important theme: a commitment to serve people and community. Curiosity, humility and empathy are the three core values that have helped me live that theme out every day. I believe that our values inform our intention which plays a key role in giving meaning to what we create. With technology becoming an increasing part of what we build and how we connect, I see data and analytics as being in a special place to help us understand, innovate and enhance human experiences shaped by both our head and heart.
