<h3 style='font-weight:bold;font-family:Courier New'><code># About Me</code></h3>

<p style='font-family:Courier New'>I'm a data professional who gets excited about learning new things. My experience as an eCommerce business owner has given me visibility into how technology is providing new means for connecting and transacting. In fact, it's what inspired me to pursue data science and develop skills that would enable me to play an active role in the fusion of our online and offline worlds.

In addition, reading and writing drive most of my learning and thinking. I recently started a project where I share some of my own writing along with blogs and books I find myself coming back to. You can find that <a href="https://taylorbickell.com/">here</a>.
